    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">
        Effective Date: 21 February 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last Updated: 22 February 2026
    </div>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        RuleSelf is designed with privacy as a core principle. All rules, configurations, and usage detection
        operate entirely on your device. RuleSelf does <strong>not collect, store, transmit, or share personal data</strong>
        through its own servers or infrastructure.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        Short version: your data stays on your device. RuleSelf has no backend, no accounts, and no user tracking.
    </div>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>RuleSelf itself does not collect any personal information.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>No account registration required</li>
        <li>No email address, name, or contact information collected</li>
        <li>No device identifiers collected by RuleSelf directly</li>
        <li>No location data collected</li>
        <li>No proprietary analytics SDK included</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        See <a href="#ads">Section 6 (Advertising)</a> for information about Google AdMob, which is used
        for free-tier users and operates under Google's own data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Background Tasks</h2>
    <p>
        All data you create (rules, schedules, app selections, custom messages) is stored locally on your device
        using Android's secure local storage. This data is never transmitted to the developer or any third party
        by RuleSelf. Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data.
    </p>
    <p>
        RuleSelf uses Android WorkManager to schedule periodic background tasks (such as midnight rule resets).
        These tasks run locally on your device and do not transmit any data externally.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permissions Used</h2>

    <div class="permission-grid">
        <div class="permission-item">
            <strong>Usage Access (PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS)</strong>
            <span>Detects which app is in the foreground and measures usage time or screen unlock counts.
            Processed locally only. Never transmitted.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="permission-item">
            <strong>Query Installed Apps (QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES)</strong>
            <span>Displays your installed apps when you create a rule. The app list is never stored externally
            or shared with anyone.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="permission-item">
            <strong>Display Over Other Apps (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW)</strong>
            <span>Shows block screens, delay countdowns, and reminder messages over other apps.
            This permission does not allow data collection.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="permission-item">
            <strong>Notifications</strong>
            <span>Displays the persistent "Rules Active" status notification and system alerts.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="permission-item">
            <strong>Run at Startup (RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED)</strong>
            <span>Ensures your rules remain active after the device restarts.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="permission-item">
            <strong>Full-Screen Intent (USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT)</strong>
            <span>Allows block and delay screens to appear as full-screen alerts when a restricted app
            is launched. Required on Android 10+. Does not allow any data collection.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="permission-item">
            <strong>Foreground Service (FOREGROUND_SERVICE / FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC)</strong>
            <span>RuleSelf runs a persistent background monitoring service to continuously detect app usage
            and enforce your rules while you use your phone. A visible notification is always shown while
            this service is active. No data is transmitted.</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Internet Usage</h2>
    <p>
        RuleSelf does not require an internet connection for core functionality. No cloud sync,
        no remote databases, and no server communication are performed by RuleSelf itself.
        Internet access is used only for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loading advertisements via Google AdMob (free users only)</li>
        <li>Processing Premium purchases via Google Play Billing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ads">6. Advertising (Free Users Only)</h2>
    <p>
        Free users of RuleSelf may see banner and rewarded advertisements served by
        <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob is a third-party advertising service operated by Google LLC.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight-box warning">
        AdMob may collect device identifiers (such as the Advertising ID / GAID), IP address, and
        app usage signals for ad personalisation and measurement. This data is handled by Google
        under their own Privacy Policy — not by RuleSelf.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Rewarded ads are entirely optional and grant one additional rule slot when watched.</li>
        <li>RuleSelf does not receive, store, or process any ad-related data.</li>
        <li>You can opt out of personalised ads via your device's Google settings
            (<em>Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalisation</em>).</li>
        <li>Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        Premium users see no advertisements. AdMob is not initialised for Premium users.
    </div>

    <h2>7. Google Play Billing</h2>
    <p>
        If you purchase Premium, payment processing is handled securely by Google Play Billing.
        RuleSelf does not receive or store your payment card details or billing information.
        Purchases are governed by Google Play's Terms of Service.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        RuleSelf does not share any data with third parties through its own systems.
        The only third-party data flows are those initiated by Google AdMob (free users) and
        Google Play Billing (purchasers), both of which are governed by Google's policies.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        RuleSelf is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
        from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through this App,
        please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        All rule data is stored using Android's secure local storage mechanisms.
        Because RuleSelf has no external servers, there is no external exposure risk from
        RuleSelf's own infrastructure. Device-level security (lock screen, encryption) protects local data.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Your Control</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete any rule at any time within the app</li>
        <li>Revoke permissions at any time via Android Settings</li>
        <li>Opt out of ad personalisation via Google Settings on your device</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to permanently remove all locally stored data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        If future updates change data practices, this policy will be updated accordingly.
        The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will reflect the most recent revision.
        Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
