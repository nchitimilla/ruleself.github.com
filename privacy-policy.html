<h1>Privacy Policy for RuleSelf</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 21 Feb 2026<br>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> 21 Feb 2026</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
RuleSelf is designed with privacy as a core principle.
RuleSelf does <strong>not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data</strong> outside of your device.
All rules, configurations, and app usage detection operate entirely locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>RuleSelf does not collect any personal information.</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>No account registration required</li>
    <li>No email address collected</li>
    <li>No name, phone number, or contact data collected</li>
    <li>No device identifiers collected</li>
    <li>No location data collected</li>
    <li>No analytics SDK included</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
All data (rules, schedules, app selections, custom messages) is stored locally on your device.
This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to the developer.
Uninstalling the app removes all stored data.
</p>

<h2>4. Permissions Used</h2>

<h3>Usage Access (PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS)</h3>
<p>
Used to detect which app is currently in the foreground and measure usage time or screen unlock counts.
This data is processed locally and never transmitted.
</p>

<h3>Installed Apps (QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES)</h3>
<p>
Used only to display your installed apps when creating rules.
No app list is stored or shared externally.
</p>

<h3>Display Over Other Apps (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW)</h3>
<p>
Required to show block screens, delay countdowns, and reminder messages over other apps.
This permission does not allow data collection.
</p>

<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p>
Used to display the persistent “Rules Active” notification and status updates.
</p>

<h3>Run at Startup</h3>
<p>
Ensures rules remain active after device reboot.
</p>

<h2>5. Internet Usage</h2>
<p>
RuleSelf does not require internet for core functionality.
No cloud sync, no server communication, no remote databases, no advertising SDKs, and no analytics services are used.
</p>

<h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
RuleSelf does not integrate with analytics providers, advertising networks, or tracking SDKs.
If Premium is purchased, payment processing is handled securely by Google Play Billing.
RuleSelf does not receive or store payment details.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
RuleSelf does not share any data with third parties.
Since no data is collected externally, there is no data to share.
</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
RuleSelf does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.
</p>

<h2>9. Data Security</h2>
<p>
All data is stored using Android’s secure local storage mechanisms.
Because no external servers are involved, there is no external exposure risk from RuleSelf itself.
</p>

<h2>10. Your Control</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Delete rules anytime</li>
    <li>Disable permissions anytime</li>
    <li>Uninstall the app to remove all data</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
If future updates change data practices, this policy will be updated accordingly.
The “Last Updated” date will reflect changes.
</p>
