    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <div class="meta">
        Effective Date: 21 February 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last Updated: 22 February 2026
    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
        By downloading, installing, or using RuleSelf ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions.
        If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>
        RuleSelf is a personal self-discipline tool that enables users to create rules governing their own app usage.
        The App operates entirely on-device; no account registration is required and no personal data is transmitted
        to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use of the App</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be 13 years of age or older to use this App.</li>
        <li>You agree to use the App only for lawful, personal self-improvement purposes.</li>
        <li>You must not reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.</li>
        <li>You must not use the App in any way that violates applicable local, national, or international laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        You are solely responsible for the rules you create, including block schedules, delay configurations, and
        any consequences resulting from enabling or disabling them. The developer accepts no responsibility for
        missed notifications, locked sessions, or disruption caused by rules you have configured.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Advertising (Free Users)</h2>
    <p>
        Free users of RuleSelf may see banner and rewarded advertisements served by Google AdMob.
        Rewarded ads are entirely optional — watching a rewarded ad may grant one additional rule slot.
        Ad personalisation and data handling are governed by Google's Privacy Policy
        (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">policies.google.com/privacy</a>).
    </p>
    <div class="highlight-box">
        Premium users see no advertisements. Upgrading to Premium disables all ad loading.
    </div>

    <h2>6. Premium Purchases</h2>
    <p>
        Premium access is offered as a one-time, non-recurring purchase processed securely through
        Google Play Billing. Key points:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>All payment processing is handled by Google. The developer does not receive or store your payment details.</li>
        <li>Refund requests are subject to Google Play's refund policy.</li>
        <li>Premium access is tied to your Google Play account and can be restored on new devices via "Restore Purchases".</li>
        <li>There is no subscription — you pay once.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
        RuleSelf, its name, logo, design, and all associated content are the intellectual property of
        Nagaraju Chitimilla. All rights are reserved. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or
        sublicense any part of the App without express written permission.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
        The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied,
        including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
        The developer does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of or inability to use
        the App, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India.
        Any disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
        of the competent courts in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>
        The developer reserves the right to discontinue, modify, or restrict access to the App at any time,
        without notice and for any reason, including but not limited to technical, legal, or business reasons.
        Termination does not entitle you to a refund unless required by Google Play's refund policy.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Severability</h2>
    <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of
        competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it
        enforceable, or severed if modification is not possible. The remaining provisions of these Terms
        shall continue in full force and effect.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Intended Use</h2>
    <p>
        RuleSelf is a personal self-discipline productivity tool intended solely for individual use by the
        account holder. It is <strong>not</strong> designed or intended for parental controls, employee
        monitoring, surveillance, or any purpose involving controlling or tracking another person's device
        or activity. Any such misuse is strictly prohibited and may violate applicable laws.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms may be updated at any time. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes
        your acceptance of the revised Terms. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page reflects the
        most recent revision.
